    "title": "Arch Linux package maintainer Robin \"Antiz\" Candau explains what the Valve collaboration means for Arch",
    "selftext": "Since Arch leader Levente Polyak's announcement on their mailing list that Valve would be providing backing for two critical projects for the distro, a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave, many in the community were speculating about what this means in a practical sense, why Valve would be interested in sponsoring these projects in particular, as well as what it means for Arch's autonomy as a community-run, volunteer-driven distro. Arch maintainer Antiz joined the A1R Podcast yesterday to answer all of these questions and put some concerns to rest!\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB62zhzGV1A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB62zhzGV1A)\n\nAs of now, Arch Linux only supports x86\\_64 systems on an official basis. Unfortunately, due to inefficiencies of their current packaging pipeline, attempting to support more now would mean practically multiplying their current workload by the amount of architectures they want to support, which is infeasible for a volunteer-run distro.\n\nBoth of the projects Valve are interested in backing are ones that Arch themselves have been interested in working on for a long time, and both relate to *significantly* streamlining the process of maintaining and signing packages for Arch in a way that would allow them to feasibly support more architectures in the future.\n\nAs stated by Antiz, Valve is going to contract some existing members of the Arch staff on a freelance basis to work on these projects. Since they have the opportunity to be able to work on them full-time, progress on this infrastructure will be made significantly faster than it would have been able to be otherwise!\n\nThey also went on to confirm that all development will be done in Arch's usual democratic, consensus-building workflow, including RFCs to discuss implementation. Valve has no interest in \"taking over\" any aspect of the distro or dictating any terms or specifics of this implementation.\n\nAs for what Valve wants to gain from this collaboration, we can only speculate at this time. But given recent leaks and rumours, it is very clear that Valve has interest in releasing ARM-powered, Linux-based gaming hardware; *probably* initially in the form of a standalone VR headset, similar to the Oculus Quest -- based on patents they've filed, as well as metadata found on Steam suggesting that Valve is currently testing arm64 versions of Proton, the FEX x86 emulator, as well as several VR titles running under Waydroid. As you may know, the SteamOS distro currently powering the Steam Deck is based on Arch Linux. Supporting Arch directly in their pre-existing desire to eventually support additional platforms and architectures would allow Valve to avoid either maintaining their own ARM package base, or switching to a different distro.\n\nTL;DW written by Antiz himself:\n\n&gt;Basically, the way packages are currently built / managed still require a few manual interventions from Package Maintainers (e.g. triggering the build itself and signing the built packages afterwards). As of now, supporting multiple architectures would mean multiplying those manual steps by the number of supported / targeted architectures. With the current number of packages compared to the current number of (volunteers) Package Maintainers maintaining them, Arch is not able to handle the extra amount of effort that it would imply.\n\n&gt;A central build service and a central secure signing enclave (the two projects concerned by that Valve \"sponsoring\") would streamline the overall process by allowing automated build and signing for packages without requiring any manual steps / interventions from Package Maintainers anymore (and it will also allow to increase the security of the process as a side benefit). Only such a streamlined / automated workflow would allow us to start working on supporting multiple architectures without implying to multiply the current amount of required effort.\n\n&gt;In other words, those projects are prerequisites to start working on multiple architectures support in a clean &amp; sane way, which is a end goal shared by both Arch and Valve.",

    "selftext": "So, I switched from Windows to Linux in June. I was interested since before then, and CrowdStrike pretty much is the nail that close any desire of mine to reinstall Windows again. So I took my blank DVD, burn the Pop!_OS ISO and I install Linux into my ASUS X44H. In short, Pop 22.04 was great, definitely a great time for me. But then I have a GRUB error, and so I install my next distro: Arch\n\nSo I follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/mjkstra/96ce7a5689d753e7a6bdd92cdc169bae) and I install Arch on my laptop. I love the fact that it's bleeding edge and AUR is definitely something that I wish all distro have. My only real issue was the GRUB error, which I managed to fix by... reinstall GRUB (Thanks, r/archlinux) and Wine. Unfortunately, Wine prefix creation doesn't seem to work on BTRFS and later when I use Arch again, I use ext4, and while that fix things, Wine still have problem that I am not willing to try and troubleshoot. Also, I use Wine to play Touhou, I can't exactly use any PC without playing Touhou anymore\n\nFinally, I use Mint, which works perfectly for me in everything that I use (minus AUR and Hyprland). It's just works out of the box. Ok, not really, I still have to setup zram and turn off several things, but afterward, it's all good. It's what I use now on my laptop\n\nMaybe when I get a new PC, I might multiboot Windows 11 LTSC (for Koikatu and every other game that I can't get to work on Linux. No game that use kernel level anti-cheat though), Mint, Arch and maybe Pop 24.04, whenever it's out",
